# -Hybrid-Active-Directory-Endpoint-Detection-Lab-with-Adversary-Simulation
Built a hybrid SOC lab integrating Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (cloud), and Splunk SIEM. Simulated attacks from Kali Linux and monitored detection across endpoints and network infrastructure. Used Splunk for log correlation and Defender for real-time alerting and response.
